# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles: customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery of small testable increments, clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, data-informed decision making, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning. Our framework supports all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations, ensuring teams can move quickly while maintaining quality and alignment.

The project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible path through five key phases: Initiation establishes the business need and stakeholder alignment through a lightweight Project One-pager; Planning transforms approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with clear acceptance criteria and risk management; Execution manages day-to-day delivery using project boards, pull request workflows, and comprehensive quality testing; Release standardizes deployments with pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, and rollback procedures; and Retrospectives capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements for future work.

Three primary roles drive project success at OctoAcme. Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules and risks, facilitate key meetings, and ensure consistent communication across stakeholders. Product Managers define what should be built to deliver customer value, prioritize the roadmap and backlog, and measure outcomes through success metrics. Developers implement features that meet acceptance criteria while maintaining high test coverage, participating in code reviews, and helping identify technical risks.

Additional specialized roles support the team's success. QA Leads ensure quality standards, coordinate test planning, and validate features against acceptance criteria. UX Designers create intuitive user interfaces and collaborate with Product Managers to ensure features meet user expectations. DevOps Engineers manage CI/CD pipelines, automate deployments, and maintain reliable infrastructure. Security Champions advocate for security best practices, review for vulnerabilities, and coordinate incident response. Stakeholder Representatives bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders, ensuring alignment between technical decisions and business goals.

Communication and quality assurance are woven throughout our processes. Teams maintain a consistent cadence with daily standups focused on progress and blockers, weekly syncs between PMs and Product Managers, twice-weekly delivery team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risk management follows a continuous lifecycle of identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring, with clear escalation paths from team-level triage through PM coordination to sponsor-level decisions for business-impacting issues. Quality is ensured through comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests, and security scanning in CI, combined with manual QA for feature acceptance and regular demos at the end of each sprint or milestone.
